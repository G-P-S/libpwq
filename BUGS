BUGS
----

 * The getline() implementation for Android causes memory corruption and
   crashes halfway through reading the /proc/status file. This only occurs
   on a quad core tablet. 
   The workaround makes linux_get_runqueue_length() always return 1, which
   will cause incorrect behavior in the manager thread.  See r267 for the
   affected area.
