Version 0.2 r77
released 3/6/2011
---

 * Add support for FreeBSD, Solaris, and Microsoft Windows

 * Fix a race condition that would cause deadlock in rare cases when either:
     1) pthread_cond_signal() was called while no other threads were 
        blocked a call to pthread_cond_wait(), or
     2) pthread_cond_signal() was called multiple times before the any thread
        blocking in a call to pthread_cond_wait() was awoken by the scheduler.

   The fix is to ensure that the call to pthread_cond_signal() occurs while
   the calling thread holds the same mutex used by the threads that call
   pthread_cond_wait().

   Credit to Joakim Johansson for finding the bug and providing a patch.
